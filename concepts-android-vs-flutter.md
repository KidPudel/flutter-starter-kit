Basic concepts in Android development and their equivalent concepts in Flutter:

1. `Activity` (Android) vs `StatefulWidget` (Flutter) - Both represent a single screen in an app, with the ability to update the UI based on user interactions or other events.

2. `Fragment` (Android) vs `StatefulWidget` (Flutter) - Both represent a portion of a screen in an app, which can be reused across multiple activities.

3. `Intent` (Android) vs `Navigator` (Flutter) - Both are used to navigate between screens in an app. An Intent is used to start a new Activity, while a Navigator is used to push and pop Routes in the app's navigation stack.

4. `XML` layout files (Android) vs `Build Methods` (Flutter) - Both are used to define the UI of a screen. In Android, the layout is defined using `XML`, while in Flutter, the layout is defined using a build method in a `StatefulWidget` or `StatelessWidget`.

5. `RecyclerView` (Android) vs `ListView` (Flutter) - Both are used to display a list of items in a scrollable view. A RecyclerView is a more flexible and powerful version of the ListView, but the basic idea is the same.

6. `SQLite` (Android) vs `sqflite` (Flutter) - Both are used to store and retrieve data from a local database. SQLite is the default database for Android, while sqflite is a popular third-party library for Flutter that provides a similar API.
