**1. Data Layer:**
In Flutter, you can follow a similar data layer structure to what you have in Android:

- **Repositories:** Continue using repositories to handle data access and abstract the data sources.
- **Remote:** This can be retained for handling remote data access, API calls, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).

However, in Flutter, you'll be using Dart instead of Kotlin, so you'll have different implementations for the repositories and remote data access.

**2. Dependency Injection:**
Flutter doesn't have a built-in dependency injection framework like Dagger in Android. You can use external libraries like `get_it` or `kiwi` for dependency injection in your Flutter project. These libraries will provide similar functionality to what you had with Dagger in your Android project.

**3. Domain Layer:**
The domain layer can be kept quite similar in both Android and Flutter. Continue defining use cases, models, and interfaces for repositories in the domain layer.

**4. Presentation Layer:**
The presentation layer in Flutter will be different due to the widget-based nature of the framework:

- **View Models:** Instead of ViewModels, you'll be working with widgets directly in Flutter. Widgets manage their own state, and you can use state management libraries like Bloc, RiverPod, or Provider to handle state at the widget level. Each widget can hold its state or observe and react to state changes from a centralized state management solution.

- **Composables (Views):** In Flutter, you'll define your UI using widgets, and they will be the equivalent of Jetpack Compose composables. Flutter's declarative UI approach allows you to create custom widgets and compose them together to build your UI.

- **States:** In Flutter, you can use Dart enums, classes, or `flutter_bloc`'s `Cubit` to manage UI states like Loading or Loaded.

**5. Navigation:**
Flutter's navigation system uses routes and the `Navigator` widget to handle screen navigation. You can create a sealed class or use Flutter's built-in `enum` for representing your screens and map them to named routes.
