# Navigation Rail
The **navigation rail** has destinations, with their respective icons and labels. It also defines the current `selectedIndex`.   
A _selected index of zero selects the first destination_, a _selected index of one selects the second destination_, and so on. For now, it's hard coded to zero.
The **navigation rail** also _defines what happens when the user selects one of the destinations_ with `onDestinationSelected`.  


```dart
SafeArea(
    child: NavigationRail(
      extended: false,
      destinations: [
        NavigationRailDestination(
          icon: Icon(Icons.home),
          label: Text('Home'),
        ),
        NavigationRailDestination(
          icon: Icon(Icons.favorite),
          label: Text('Favorites'),
        ),
      ],
      selectedIndex: 0,
      onDestinationSelected: (value) {
        print('selected: $value');
      },
    ),
  ),
```

The `Navigator` widget displays screens as a stack using the correct transition animations for the target platform. To navigate to a new screen, access the `Navigator` through the routeâ€™s `BuildContext` and call imperative methods such as `push()` or `pop()`:

```dart
onPressed: () {
  Navigator.of(context).push(
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => const SongScreen(song: song),
    ),
  );
},
child: Text(song.name),
```

Because `Navigator` keeps a stack of `Route` objects (representing the history stack), The `push()` method also takes a `Route` object. The `MaterialPageRoute` object is a subclass of `Route` that specifies the transition animations for Material Design.
